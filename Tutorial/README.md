## Step 1: Creating API accounts
This project utilizes the NYT API. You can get started by following the [directions](https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started) to create an account, and build an app to get the API license key. Once you sign up, create an app, this one is called LAMPI-News and I gave it access to the Article Search, Times Wire, and Top Stories APIs.
